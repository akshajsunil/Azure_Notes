## Top benefits of cloud computing

Cloud computing is a big shift from the traditional way businesses think about IT resources. Here are seven common reasons organizations are turning to cloud computing services:



### Cost

Cloud computing [eliminates the capital expense] of buying hardware and software and setting up and running on-site datacenters—the racks of servers, the round-the-clock electricity for power and cooling, and the IT experts for managing the infrastructure. It adds up fast.
Reduce capital Expenditure and only have Operational Expentiture



### Speed

Most cloud computing services are provided self service and on demand, so even vast amounts of computing resources can be provisioned in minutes, typically with just a few mouse clicks, giving businesses a lot of flexibility and taking the pressure off capacity planning.



### Global scale

The benefits of cloud computing services include the ability to scale elastically. In cloud speak, that means  the right amount of IT resources—for example, more or less computing power, storage, bandwidth—right when they’re needed, and from the right geographic location.



### Productivity

On-site datacenters typically require a lot of “racking and stacking”—hardware setup, software patching, and other time-consuming IT management chores. Cloud computing removes the need for many of these tasks, so IT teams can spend time on achieving more important business goals.


### Performance

The biggest cloud computing services run on a worldwide network of secure datacenters, which are regularly upgraded  to the latest generation of fast and efficient computing hardware. This offers several benefits over a single corporate datacenter, including reduced network latency for applications and greater economies of scale.



### Reliability

Cloud computing makes data backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity easier and less expensive because data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites on the cloud provider’s network.

### Security

Many cloud providers offer a broad set of policies, technologies, and controls that strengthen your security posture overall, helping protect your data, apps, and infrastructure from potential threats

# Cloud service models
Cloud computing types are service deployment models that let you choose the level of control over your information and types of services you need to provide. There are three main types of cloud computing services, sometimes called the cloud computing stack because they build on top of one another.

## IaaS

The first cloud computing type is [infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-iaas/), which is used for Internet-based access to storage and computing power. The most basic category of cloud computing types, IaaS lets you rent IT infrastructure - servers and virtual machines, storage, networks, and operating systems - from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis.

## PaaS

The second cloud computing type is [platform-as-a-service (PaaS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-paas/) that gives developers the tools to build and host web applications. PaaS is designed to give users access to the components they require to quickly develop and operate web or mobile applications over the Internet, without worrying about setting up or managing the underlying infrastructure of servers, storage, networks, and databases.

## SaaS

The third cloud computing type is [software-as-a-service (SaaS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-saas/) which is used for web-based applications. SaaS is a method for delivering software applications over the Internet where cloud providers host and manage the software applications making it easier to have the same application on all of your devices at once by accessing it in the cloud.

## ServerLess
You dont have to have any servers. Lets a single function be hosted , deployed , run and managed on its own.

Model | Characteristics | Examples
------------ | ------------ |  -------
IaaS| • Organization has complete control of the infrastructure.<br/> • Dynamic and flexible. You can do almost anything.<br/> • Cost varies depending on consumption.<br/> • Services are highly scalable.<br/> • Multiple users share a single piece of hardware | VM, VNet, Storage
PaaS | • Resources are virtualized and can easily be scaled up or down as needed.<br/> • Services often assist with the development, testing and deployment of apps.<br/> • Multi-user access via the same development application.<br/> • Integrates web services and databases. | App Services, Azure CDN, Cosmos DB
SaaS | • Managed from a central location.<br/> • Hosted on a remote server.<br/> • Accessible over the internet.<br/> • Users not responsible for hardware or software updates.<br/> • Rate limiting/QoS. | Microsoft 365

# Cloud Architecture Models

* Private cloud is Azure on your own hardware in a location of your choice. All the benefits of public cloud, but you can lock it down. A lot of staff required.

* Public cloud is Azure, AWS, GCP. No upfront costs, but monthly usage. Little control over services and infrastructure. 

* A hybrid cloud model is the best of private and public, but could be complex.

# Regions And Availabilty Zones

#### Definition :
A region is a set of datacenters deployed within a latency-defined perimeter and connected through a dedicated regional lowlatency network.
#### Simpilfied :
Two or more data centers, not too far from each other, connected with a fiber connection

**You will often have to choose which is the most important: location, features or price.**

---
* All (except Brazil South) are paired within the same geographic area.
* If the primary region has an outage, you can fail over to the secondary region.
* Only one region in a pair is updated at any one time
* Some services use paired regions for replication.
---
 * Each Availability Zone is a physical location within a region.
 * Each zone has its own power, cooling and networking.
 * Each region has a minimum of three zones.

# Resource Group and ARM (Azure Resource Manager)

-   **Resource** - A manageable item that is available through Azure. Virtual machines, storage accounts, web apps, databases, and virtual networks are examples of resources.
-   **Resource group** - A container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. The resource group includes those resources that you want to manage as a group. 
- **ARM** - All interaction with Azure resouces go thorugh the ARM. It is the main Azure Architecture component for creating , updating and manipulating resources.

# Compute

### virtual machine

* A virtual machine is your machine exclusively 
* You don't buy, own or control any hardware, azure does this.
* Virtual machine are IaaS offering
* Can use azure tools 
* Price goes up as resources go up, u pay by the hour.

---

# Scale Sets

* Let's you manage a group of identical,load balanced VMs.
* They are identical VMs, that can be activated or deactivated as needed
* A baseline VM for the scale set ensures application stability. A baseline VM is what you copy to make the scale set VMs.
* As resources usage increases , more VMs are activated to take the load.
* You only pay for the VM, storage and networking resources you use. Nothing additional for scale sets.

# App Services - Paas

It is an easy way to host and manage your web application.
* App services are PaaS offering on Azure
* **Web Apps** are used to host web sites and web application.
* **Web Apps for Containers** can host your existing container images.
* **API Apps** can host your data backend services.

# Azure Container Instance 
Hosts and runs your containers on Azure. Containers have less overhead than virtual machines and can be deployed consistently
* Users to run Container Workloads(process)
* On Demand contanerization


# Azure Kubernetes Service 

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system for automating application deployment , scaling and management.
* Reuse your container architecture by managing it in Kubernetes. This makes your setup quicker and confidence in the system increase
* Standard Azure Services Included

# Azure Container Registry (ACR)


* Keep track of current valid container images
* Manages files and artifacts for containers
* Feeds container images to ACI and AKS
* Use Azure identity and security features


# Azure Virtual Desktop

Azure Virtual Desktop is a completely virtualized version of Windows, meaning it runs 100% in the cloud.



# Functions
Serverless Azure offering. A function does one compute action each time it is invoked

• Smallest compute service on Azure 
• A single function of compute 
• Called, or invoked, via a standard web address (URL) 
• Runs once and stops
Dont Worry about maintanince , processes, VM Created.

# Virtual Network

VNET peering is a feature of Azure that allows you to **create a direct connection between two Virtual Networks**. This means you can connect virtual machines from different VNETs on the same network domain and they will be able to communicate with each other as if they were connected by a physical or wireless link.

• An address space is a range of IP addresses you can use for your resources. 
• A subnet is a smaller network, which is part of your VNet. Use these for security and logical division of resources.
• A VNet is in a single region and single subscription.
• VNets in the cloud can scale and have high availability and isolation


# Load Balancer

Load Balancer distributes new inbound flows that arrive on the Load Balancer's frontend to backend pool instances, according to rules and health probes

# VPN Gateway


* A VPN Gateway is a specific VNet Gateway. It consists of two or more dedicated VMs. 
* VNet Gateway + “vpn” becomes a VPN Gateway. 
* Sends encrypted data between Azure and on premises network. 
* Azure Gateway Subnet, secure tunnel and on-premises gateway makes up a VPN Gateway scenario

# Application Gateway

• It works on the HTTP request of the traffic, instead of the IP address and port. 
• Traffic from a specific web address can go to a specific machine. 
• Is a fit for most other Azure services. 
• Supports auto-scaling, end-to-end encryption, zone redundancy and multi-site hosting

# Content Delivery Networks (CDN)

A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.
Stores a cached version of your application on an edge node. Provides better performance and less traffic to your main server. Content cache is updated as necessary

# Azure ExpressRoute
Direct link between on-premises and Azure. Enables a private, secure, high-bandwidth, low-latency connection

# Storage
## blob
Blob storage is your general kind of storagethat can hold anything you'd like.
It comes in three varieties: block, append, and page.
Blobs are stored in containers,And you can choose Hot, Cool, or Archive pricing tiers.
## Disk Storage
Disk storage is what you attach to your VMs.
The types of disks are HDD,SSD, premium SSD, and ultra disk.
They increase in speed and price while the latency go down.

## File storage
File storage is for mitigating some of the issues with having file storage on-premises.

## Archive 
very cheap way to store large amounts of data

# Authentication & Authorization

Authentication means to confirm your own identity, while authorization means to grant access to the system. In simple terms, authentication verifies who you are, while authorization verifies what you have access to.

## Azure Active Directory
 * You can’t use Azure without AAD
 * Not same as Active Directory (AD)
 * The first service of every new account will be an Azure Active Directory instance
 * AAD can help you manage users in a hybrid cloud architecture between on-premises and Azure.
 
### Tenent

A tenant is a special instance of AAD. It is the first AAD instance that gets created when a new Azure account is set up. A user can be a member or guest of up to 500 tenants

### Multi-Factor Authentication

An extra layer of security using something you know, something you have and something you are

### Single Sign-On

Use a single username and password to log in to multiple applications using Azure Active Directory


# Security in Azure

### Defense in Depth

You need multiple layers of defense for your infrastructure. Azure has physical, identity, perimeter, network, compute, gateways and firewalls, and data as protection layers.

### Azure Security Center

Monitor security hygiene for VMs. Define policies to protect your resources better and respond to incidents


### Securing Network Connectivity 

A firewall controls the data coming in and out of a network based on rules. Azure protects against DDoS attacks with no downtime to you. A network security group protects a subnet or virtual machine.


### Azure Key Vault

A secure way to share access to applications and resources with third parties without ever revealing any credentials

### Azure Information Protection

Share files and data inside and outside of Azure and still maintain control over that data. You can control who views, edits, prints and more.

### Azure Dedicated Hosts

Your own dedicated Azure hardware to install Windows, Linux or SQL Server VMs on. Gives you control without losing cloud benefits like scaling, scale sets, fault isolation and availability zones

### Azure Sentinel

Collect, aggregate, analyze and present security issues automatically for you to take action

### Microsoft Defender for Identity

You secure and manage users of your organization. Monitor users’ behavior, create a baseline of this behavior and report on any anomalies from it.



## Governance

• Azure Policy ensures that policies applied to resources are compliant. 
• A policy is a set of rules to ensure compliant resources. 
• Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures user compliance through assigning a role to a user. A role is a combination of security principal, role definition and scope.
• Locks make sure that subscriptions, resource groups or resources are either not modified or not deleted.2 types  - read only and delete
• Blueprints are templates for creating standard Azure environments.
• The Azure Advisor for Security Assistance is part of the Security Center.
